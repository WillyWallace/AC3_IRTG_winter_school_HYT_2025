## Seminar on the application of the Virga Sniffer

The Virga-Sniffer is a tool to detect virga (precipitation which completely evaporates before reaching the surface). As input source radar reflectivity and ceilometer cloud-base height observations are mandatory. Optionally but highly recommended are the additional information of radar mean Doppler velocity, lifting condensation level and surface rain detection.
